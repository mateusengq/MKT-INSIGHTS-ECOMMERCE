    "** Inputs related to Analysis for additional reference:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why do we need customer Segmentation?\n",
    "As every customer is unique and can be targeted in different ways. The Customer segmentation plays an important role in this case. The segmentation helps to understand profiles of customers and can be helpful in defining cross sell/upsell/activation/acquisition strategies.\n",
    "2. What is RFM Segmentation?\n",
    "RFM Segmentation is an acronym of recency, frequency and monetary based segmentation.\n",
    "Recency is about when the last order of a customer. It means the number of days since a customer\n",
    "made the last purchase. If it’s a case for a website or an app, this could be interpreted as the last\n",
    "visit day or the last login time.\n",
    "Frequency is about the number of purchases in a given period. It could be 3 months, 6 months or 1\n",
    "year. So we can understand this value as for how often or how many customers used the product of\n",
    "a company. The bigger the value is, the more engaged the customers are.\n",
    "Alternatively\n",
    "We can define, average duration between two transactions\n",
    "Monetary is the total amount of money a customer spent in that given period. Therefore big\n",
    "spenders will be differentiated with other customers such as MVP or VIP.\n",
    "What is LTV and How to define it?\n",
    "In the current world, almost every retailer promotes its subscription and this is further used to\n",
    "understand the customer lifetime. Retailer can manage these customers in better manner if they\n",
    "know which customer is high life time value.\n",
    "Customer lifetime value (LTV) can also be defined as the monetary value of a customer relationship,\n",
    "based on the present value of the projected future cash flows from the customer relationship.\n",
    "Customer lifetime value is an important concept in that it encourages firms to shift their focus from\n",
    "quarterly profits to the long-term health of their customer relationships. Customer lifetime value is\n",
    "an important metric because it represents an upper limit on spending to acquire new customers. For\n",
    "this reason it is an important element in calculating payback of advertising spent in marketing mix\n",
    "modelling.\n",
    "Why do need to predict Customer Lifetime Value?\n",
    "The LTV is an important building block in campaign design and marketing mix management.\n",
    "Although targeting models can help to identify the right customers to be targeted, LTV analysis can\n",
    "help to quantify the expected outcome of targeting in terms of revenues and profits. The LTV is also\n",
    "important because other major metrics and decision thresholds can be derived from it.\n",
    "For example, the LTV is naturally an upper limit on the spending to acquire a customer, and the sum\n",
    "of the LTVs for all of the customers of a brand, known as the customer equity, is a major metric forbusiness valuations. Similarly to many other problems of marketing analytics and algorithmic\n",
    "marketing, LTV modelling can be approached from descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive\n",
    "perspectives.\n",
    "How Next Purchase Day helps to Retailers?\n",
    "Our objective is to analyse when our customer will purchase products in the future so for such\n",
    "customers we can build strategy and can come up with strategies and marketing campaigns\n",
    "accordingly.\n",
    "a. Group-1: Customers who will purchase in more than 60 days\n",
    "b. Group-2: Customers who will purchase in 30-60 days\n",
    "c. Group-3: Customers who will purchase in 0-30 days\n",
    "What is Cohort Analysis? How it will be helpful?\n",
    "A cohort is a group of users who share a common characteristic that is identified in this report by an\n",
    "Analytics dimension.\n",
    "For example, all users with the same Acquisition Date belong to the same cohort.\n",
    "The Cohort Analysis report lets you isolate and analyze cohort behaviour.\n",
    "Cohort analysis in e-commerce means to monitor your customers’ behaviour based on common\n",
    "traits they share – the first product they bought, when they became customers, etc. - - to find\n",
    "patterns and tailor marketing activities for the group.\n",
